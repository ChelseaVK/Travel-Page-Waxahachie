            <h2>Discover Waxahachie</h2>
            <h3>History with a Heartbeat</h3>

            <p>
              Just a quick hop from Dallas, Waxahachie—aka the Gingerbread
              City—is a charming escape full of photo-worthy Victorian
              architecture and sweet Southern hospitality. With over 50 historic
              homes dressed in ornate trim, it's like stepping into a vintage
              postcard (without needing a time machine). The town's lively
              downtown buzzes with antique shops, cafes, and colorful murals,
              while annual events like the Crape Myrtle Festival bring the
              streets to life. Add in a picturesque courthouse that’s straight
              out of a storybook, and you’ve got a destination that’s as
              welcoming as it is unforgettable. Waxahachie isn’t just a
              stop—it’s a vibe.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond its storybook streets, Waxahachie serves up thrills and
              hidden gems—from ghost tours that whisper tales of haunted
              historic homes to film buffs exploring iconic movie locations and
              the recreation of the Munster house - yes, from the beloved TV
              show. Art lovers can stroll through murals and sculptures on the
              city’s creative trail, while outdoor enthusiasts hit the
              hike-and-bike trails around scenic Getzendaner Park. The downtown
              square pulses with personality, hosting everything from food truck
              fests to spirited farmer’s markets. And when festival season rolls
              in, the Scarborough Renaissance Festival transforms the town into
              a merry, medieval playground. Whatever your vibe—spooky, sporty,
              artsy, or hungry—Waxahachie’s got a moment waiting for you.

            <p>
              Hi! My name is Chelsea. I've been living in Texas for a couple of

              do. I created this page as a love letter to Waxahachie, one of my
              favorite Texas cities. I hope you'll visit soon!
